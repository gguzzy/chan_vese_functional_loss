# Reimagining Image Segmentation using Active Contour

Welcome to the official repository for the paper "Reimagining Image Segmentation using Active Contour: From Chan Vese Algorithm into a Proposal Novel Functional Loss Framework" by Gianluca Guzzetta. This repository contains the MATLAB and PyTorch implementation of the methods discussed in the paper, aimed at advancing the field of image segmentation through the use of a novel functional loss framework based on active contour methods.

## Overview

Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, involving the division of an image into multiple segments to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. This project utilizes the Chan-Vese active contour modeling method, renowned for its effectiveness in capturing complex object boundaries and operating independently of image intensities.

## Features

- **Chan-Vese Algorithm Implementation**: Detailed MATLAB scripts demonstrating the efficacy of the Chan-Vese method in capturing complex object boundaries.
- **Novel Functional Loss Framework**: Implementation in PyTorch of a new loss function, which incorporates active contour concepts for improved segmentation performance.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed explanation of methods, including the level set method and noise introduction techniques for robust image processing.
- **Experimentation and Results**: Contains pre-processed datasets and scripts to reproduce the results discussed in the paper below.
